# Local Food Waste Reduction System

## Project Overview
The Local Food Waste Reduction System is a web-based platform developed using PHP and the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.  
The main aim of this project is to reduce food waste and support people in need by connecting food donors with receivers in the local area.

The system helps restaurants, grocery stores, and households donate their extra food before it gets wasted. On the other side, NGOs, shelters, and individuals can request and collect the available food.  
This project promotes both community welfare and environmental sustainability by using technology to manage food redistribution effectively.
